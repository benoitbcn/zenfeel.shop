Zenfeel — Stock image integration
-----------------------------------
The site uses lifestyle photos pulled at runtime from Unsplash Source per collection theme.
License: Unsplash License — free for commercial and non-commercial uses, attribution not required (appreciated).

Links:
- Unsplash License: https://unsplash.com/license
- Terms: https://unsplash.com/terms

Implementation:
- Each <img> points to an Unsplash Source URL like: https://source.unsplash.com/1200x900/?matcha,bamboo,steam&sig=<hash>
- If a remote call fails, a local lightweight placeholder /assets/img/<slug>.webp is shown as fallback.

To self-host later:
1) Download chosen images and save them at /assets/img/<slug>.webp (1200x900 WebP, q~70).
2) Replace the <img> src to the local path (simple find/replace or keep Unsplash as backup).
